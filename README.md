grunt plugin to run tests via the command-line mocha.

Other mocha plugins for grunt use the mocha library
programmatically, which loses a lot of useful
diagnostic information. This plugin is a workaround
for that.

It will also write coverage reports (generated by
blanket) to a directory if the reporter is set to
html-cov.
